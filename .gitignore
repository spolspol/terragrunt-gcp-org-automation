# --- General ---
# Ignore files and directories starting with .terraform, .terragrunt, or .tofu
# This covers .terraform/, .terragrunt-cache/, .tofu/, .terraform.lock.hcl, etc.
# If you have specific dotfiles you want to commit (e.g., .terraform-version for tfenv),
# you can explicitly un-ignore them with a '!' prefix after these lines:
# Example: !.terraform-version
.terraform*
.terragrunt*
.tofu*

# macOS system files
.DS_*

# --- Terragrunt ---
# Terragrunt dependency lock file (does not start with a dot)
terragrunt.hcl.lock.json

# --- Terraform & OpenTofu ---
# Note: .terraform.lock.hcl is covered by .terraform* above.
# If OpenTofu uses a lock file like 'tofu.lock.hcl' (not starting with '.tofu'),
# you would add it here. However, '.tofu.lock.hcl' would be covered by '.tofu*'.

# State files (CRITICAL TO IGNORE if not using remote state for sensitive data)
# Local state files can also be created temporarily even with remote state.
*.tfstate
*.tfstate.*

# Plan files (can contain sensitive data and are usually temporary)
# These are often generated locally and should not be committed.
*.tfplan

# Raw HCL artifact files - use JSON artifacts instead
artifacts/*.hcl
artifacts/*.tf
artifacts/raw-*

# Crash log files
# Generated by Terraform/Tofu in case of a crash.
crash.log
crash.*.log # Catches logs like crash.12345.log

# Override files
# These are for local overrides and generally not meant to be shared/committed.
override.tf
override.tf.json
*_override.tf
*_override.tf.json

# --- Optional common ignores (uncomment if needed) ---

# Variable definition files that might contain secrets.
# Best practice is to manage secrets outside of version control (e.g., Vault, SOPS).
# *.tfvars
# *.tfvars.json
# secrets.auto.tfvars

# CLI configuration files (usually user-specific or stored in home directory,
# but sometimes placed in project root by mistake or for specific local setups).
# .terraformrc
# terraform.rc

# Version files for tfenv/tofuenv.
# Commit these if your team standardizes on versions via these files in the project.
# Otherwise, they can be personal preference and ignored.
# If you uncommented the un-ignore rule for .terraform-version above, keep this commented.
# .terraform-version
# .tofu-version

# Zip archives of modules (if you use `terraform archive` or similar)
# *.zip
