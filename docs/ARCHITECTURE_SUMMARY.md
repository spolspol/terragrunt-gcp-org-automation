# Infrastructure Architecture: Principles and Design Rationale

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the architectural principles and design rationale behind the organization's GCP infrastructure. Our architecture leverages OpenTofu (an open-source Terraform fork), Terragrunt for configuration management, and Google Cloud Platform for hosting. The design emphasizes security, scalability, operational excellence, and cost optimization while maintaining flexibility for future growth.

### Key Design Principles
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** with version control and peer review
- **Hierarchical configuration** with inheritance and overrides
- **Separation of concerns** between infrastructure layers
- **Security by default** with least privilege access
- **Operational excellence** through automation and standardization

### Technology Stack
- **OpenTofu 1.9.1**: Infrastructure provisioning engine
- **Terragrunt 0.80.2**: Configuration management and orchestration
- **Google Cloud Platform**: Cloud infrastructure provider
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD automation
- **ArgoCD 8.1.3**: GitOps continuous delivery platform
- **Google Secret Manager**: Secrets management
- **External Secrets Operator**: Kubernetes secrets synchronization

## Tool Selection Rationale

### Why OpenTofu?

OpenTofu was chosen over Terraform for several strategic reasons:

1. **Open Governance**: As a Linux Foundation project, OpenTofu ensures long-term stability without vendor lock-in
2. **Community-Driven**: Development priorities are set by the community, not commercial interests
3. **License Stability**: Immune to licensing changes that could impact enterprise usage
4. **Terraform Compatibility**: Maintains full compatibility with existing Terraform configurations
5. **Future-Proof**: Protects against potential commercial restrictions or pricing changes

### Why Terragrunt?

Terragrunt provides essential capabilities for managing infrastructure at scale:

1. **DRY Principle**: Eliminates configuration duplication through templates and inheritance
2. **Hierarchical Configuration**: Natural representation of organizational structure
3. **Dependency Management**: Explicit declaration and resolution of resource dependencies
4. **State Management**: Automated remote state configuration with locking
5. **Bulk Operations**: Execute commands across multiple modules efficiently

### Why Google Cloud Platform?

GCP was selected based on:

1. **Enterprise Security**: Comprehensive security features and compliance certifications
2. **Global Infrastructure**: Presence in required regions with low latency
3. **Managed Services**: Rich ecosystem of managed services reducing operational overhead
4. **Cost Efficiency**: Competitive pricing with sustained use discounts
5. **Innovation**: Access to cutting-edge services and features

## Current Infrastructure State

### Active Deployment
The infrastructure currently manages:
- **1 Development Environment** (dev-01) with full networking, compute, and GitOps platform
- **25M IP Addresses** hierarchically organized across development, perimeter, and production
- **13 Secrets** managed through Google Secret Manager
- **3 Virtual Machines** (Linux, Web, SQL Server)
- **1 GKE Cluster** with ArgoCD bootstrap and private nodes
- **NAT Gateway Stack** providing centralized egress

### Dynamic Configuration Patterns
All configurations now use Terragrunt directory functions for path resolution:

```hcl
locals {
  # Dynamic path construction replaces hardcoded paths
  project_base_path = dirname(dirname(get_terragrunt_dir()))
  secrets_base_path = "${local.project_base_path}/secrets"
  networking_base_path = "${dirname(get_terragrunt_dir())}/networking"
  
  # Resource name extraction from directory structure
  resource_name = basename(get_terragrunt_dir())
}

dependency "project" {
  config_path = find_in_parent_folders("project")
}
```

This pattern eliminates hardcoded relative paths and enables portable, maintainable configurations.

## Core Architectural Principles

### 1. Hierarchical Configuration Management

The infrastructure follows a strict hierarchy that mirrors organizational structure:

```
root.hcl                    # Global settings, state backend
├── account.hcl            # Account-level configuration
├── env.hcl               # Environment-specific settings
├── project.hcl           # Project configuration
└── region.hcl           # Regional settings
```

**Rationale**: This hierarchy enables:
- Configuration inheritance with selective overrides
- Clear separation between global and local settings
- Simplified multi-environment management
- Reduced configuration duplication

### 2. Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)

All reusable configurations are centralized:

- **Templates** in `_common/templates/` for resource patterns
- **Module versions** in `_common/common.hcl` for consistency
- **Shared variables** inherited through the hierarchy

**Rationale**: 
- Single source of truth for configurations
- Simplified updates and maintenance
- Reduced human error
- Consistent resource provisioning

### 3. Separation of Concerns

Clear boundaries between:
- **Infrastructure layers** (network, compute, data)
- **Environments** (dev, staging, production)
- **Security contexts** (DMZ, internal)
- **Operational concerns** (provisioning, configuration, secrets)

**Rationale**:
- Independent evolution of components
- Blast radius limitation
- Clear ownership boundaries
- Simplified troubleshooting

### 4. Environment Parity with Flexibility

All environments follow the same patterns but with appropriate variations:

```hcl
# Production
machine_type = "n2-standard-8"
disk_size_gb = 100
preemptible = false

# Development
machine_type = "n2-standard-2"
disk_size_gb = 20
preemptible = true
```

**Rationale**:
- Consistent behavior across environments
- Cost optimization for non-production
- Production-like testing environments
- Easy promotion between environments

### 5. Security by Default
