## Core Architectural Principles

### 1. Hierarchical Configuration Management

The infrastructure follows a strict hierarchy that mirrors organizational structure:

```
root.hcl                    # Global settings, state backend
├── account.hcl            # Account-level configuration
├── env.hcl               # Environment-specific settings
├── project.hcl           # Project configuration
└── region.hcl           # Regional settings
```

**Rationale**: This hierarchy enables:
- Configuration inheritance with selective overrides
- Clear separation between global and local settings
- Simplified multi-environment management
- Reduced configuration duplication

### 2. Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)

All reusable configurations are centralized:

- **Templates** in `_common/templates/` for resource patterns
- **Module versions** in `_common/common.hcl` for consistency
- **Shared variables** inherited through the hierarchy

**Rationale**: 
- Single source of truth for configurations
- Simplified updates and maintenance
- Reduced human error
- Consistent resource provisioning

### 3. Separation of Concerns

Clear boundaries between:
- **Infrastructure layers** (network, compute, data)
- **Environments** (dev, staging, production)
- **Security contexts** (DMZ, internal)
- **Operational concerns** (provisioning, configuration, secrets)

**Rationale**:
- Independent evolution of components
- Blast radius limitation
- Clear ownership boundaries
- Simplified troubleshooting

### 4. Environment Parity with Flexibility

All environments follow the same patterns but with appropriate variations:

```hcl
# Production
machine_type = "n2-standard-8"
disk_size_gb = 100
preemptible = false

# Development
machine_type = "n2-standard-2"
disk_size_gb = 20
preemptible = true
```

**Rationale**:
- Consistent behavior across environments
- Cost optimization for non-production
- Production-like testing environments
- Easy promotion between environments

### 5. Security by Default

Security is built into every layer:

- **Network isolation**: Private subnets by default
- **Identity management**: Service accounts with least privilege
- **Secrets management**: No hardcoded secrets, Google Secret Manager integration
- **Encryption**: At-rest and in-transit encryption
- **Audit logging**: Comprehensive audit trails

**Rationale**:
- Compliance with security best practices

include "compute_template" {
  path = "${get_repo_root()}/_common/templates/compute_instance.hcl"
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Consistent resource configuration
- Centralized best practices
- Simplified resource creation
- Easy updates across all resources

  mock_outputs = {
    network_name = "mock-network"
  }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Clear infrastructure relationships
- Automated dependency resolution
- Safe parallel execution
- Simplified troubleshooting

### Centralized State Management

All state is stored in a centralized GCS bucket:

```hcl
remote_state {
